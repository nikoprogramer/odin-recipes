        <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>
        <p>
            <ul> Pizza dough:
                <li>355 ml warm water</li>
                <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
                <li>490g bread flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoons sugar</li>
                
            </ul>
            <ul> For toppings:
                <li>tomato sauce</li> 
                <li>mozzarella cheese</li> 
                <li>italian pepperoni</li> 
                <li>thin-sliced mushrooms</li> 
                <li>pineapple</li> 
            </ul>
        
        </p>
        <p> <h3> Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Proof the yeast:</strong> <p> Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Make and knead the pizza dough:</strong>
                    <p> Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</p>
                    <p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</p>
                    <p>The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</p>
                </li> 
                <li><strong>Let the dough rise: </strong>
                    <p>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</p>
                    <p>Cover the dough with plastic wrap.</p>
                    <p>The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.</p>
                </li> 
                <li><strong>Divide the dough into 2 balls:</strong>
                    <p>Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.</p>
                    <p>Form 2 round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).</p>
                </li> 
                <li><strong>Prep the toppings:</strong>
                    <p>Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.</p>
                    <p>About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.</p>
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <strong>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Brush the dough top with olive oil</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal, put flattened dough on top.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Slide pizza into the oven</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bake the pizza</strong>
                    <p>Bake pizza in the 475Â°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</p>
